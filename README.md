Task Overview:

A Dockerized FastAPI user management API is no longer authenticating users, with all JWT-protected endpoints returning unauthorized errors. Your challenge is to troubleshoot and resolve the misconfiguration or code error causing token-based authentication to fail in the containerized deployment.

Guidance:

Determine why valid JWT tokens are consistently rejected after the service is deployed via Docker, even when these tokens are generated via the intended process. Review how environment variables are loaded, how the authentication logic interacts with the configuration, and ensure correct token and secret handling across the stack. Examine the application's configuration, database connection, and Dockerized environment to uncover and resolve the root cause.

Objectives:

Restore user authentication so that valid JWT tokens grant access to protected endpoints within the running service. Ensure that authorized requests succeed while invalid requests are still rejected. The application must reliably connect to the user database and handle authentication securely in its Docker environment.

How to Verify:

Test the protected endpoint using a valid JWT token issued by the authentication process. Successful authentication should return user data with an HTTP 200 status. Invalid tokens should result in HTTP 401 responses. Confirm that authentication passes in a running Docker container and that log messages no longer indicate credential errors for valid authentication attempts.
